        <p>
          After graduating high school. I studied development and
          industrialization for two years in PAID in Cameroun.
          <br />
          As a development agent working with ONGs and people from different
          origin around the world was a pleasure. <br />
          Then I travelled to America and I learned system administration with
          Linux and python.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student at <strong>Thinkful</strong>. I've begun my journey to
          becoming a software developer and it's been an amazing experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're looking to hire a new developer(or a partner for a project
          in software development), please reach out! and let's build something
          strong and reliable.
